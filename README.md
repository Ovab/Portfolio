# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio website's repo below are some setup instructions if you'd like to run it locally.

It's built on nuxt 3 [(docs here)](https://nuxt.com/docs) as it's JS framework, for it's styling I use TailwindCSS [(docs here)](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Any back-end (ex. Contact form) will be done in Node through Nuxt's own stuff or with Netlify functions (to be decided)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

It's deployed to netlify so I don't have to worry about that :)
